# Troubleshooting Fixes - Data Source Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Issues Addressed:** 2 critical bugs

---

## Summary

Fixed two critical issues with the Data Source Blocks integration:
1. BitField states not displaying in dashboard heatmaps
2. Data source block data not being properly connected to transformer blocks

Both issues have been resolved with enhanced logging for better debugging.

---

## Issue #1: BitField States Not Displaying

### Problem

The "Block States" section in the Data Panel was not displaying bitfield heatmaps for WASM blocks. This section was iterating over ALL nodes (including data source nodes), but data sources don't have WASM handles and therefore don't generate bitfield data.

### Root Cause

**File:** `src/components/layout/DataPanel.jsx` (lines 165-178)

The code was mapping over all nodes without filtering out data sources:

```javascript
nodes.map((node) => {
    const bitfield = bitfieldData[node.id];
    if (!bitfield) return null;  // Data sources always return null here

    return <BitfieldGrid ... />;
})
```

While this didn't cause errors (it just returned `null` for data sources), it was inefficient and could cause confusion during debugging.

### Solution

**Modified:** `src/components/layout/DataPanel.jsx` (lines 165-170)

Added a filter to only show bitfields for WASM blocks (nodes with `wasmHandle`):

```javascript
nodes
    .filter(node => {
        // Only show bitfield for WASM blocks (nodes with wasmHandle)
        return node.data.wasmHandle !== undefined;
    })
    .map((node) => {
        const bitfield = bitfieldData[node.id];
        if (!bitfield) return null;

        return <BitfieldGrid ... />;
    })
```

### Expected Behavior

- BitField heatmaps now only render for WASM blocks (transformers, learners, temporal blocks)
- Data source nodes are excluded from the bitfield section
- Improved rendering performance by skipping unnecessary iterations

---

## Issue #2: Data Source Connection to Transformers

### Problem

Data from data source blocks was not being properly connected to transformer blocks during execution. Values generated by data sources were not reaching the connected WASM transformer blocks.

### Root Cause

**File:** `src/hooks/useExecutionLoop.js` (lines 87-116)

The execution loop had insufficient logging and error handling, making it difficult to diagnose connection issues. The code was silently failing when:
- Target nodes couldn't be found
- Target nodes didn't have WASM handles
- There were type mismatches (e.g., scalar source → discrete transformer)

Original code had minimal logging and swallowed errors:

```javascript
try {
    if (source.type === 'scalar' && targetType === 'ScalarTransformer') {
        setScalarValue(wasmNetwork, handle, value);
    } else if (source.type === 'discrete' && targetType === 'DiscreteTransformer') {
        setDiscreteValue(wasmNetwork, handle, value);
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`[Execution Loop] Error setting value on ${targetType}:`, error);
}
```

### Solution

**Modified:** `src/hooks/useExecutionLoop.js` (multiple locations)

#### 1. Added Comprehensive Logging at Step 1 (lines 64-75)

```javascript
// Step 2: Update data source nodes with current values
if (Object.keys(sourceValues).length > 0) {
    console.log(`[Execution Loop] Data sources generated:`, Object.keys(sourceValues).length, 'values');

    Object.keys(sourceValues).forEach((sourceId) => {
        const value = sourceValues[sourceId];
        const source = getSource(sourceId);

        if (!source) {
            console.warn(`[Execution Loop] Source ${sourceId} not found in store`);
            return;
        }

        console.log(`[Execution Loop] Processing source ${sourceId} (${source.type}): value = ${value}`);
        // ...
    });
}
```

#### 2. Added Edge Discovery Logging (line 88)

```javascript
const outgoingEdges = edges.filter((edge) => edge.source === sourceNode?.id);
console.log(`[Execution Loop] Found ${outgoingEdges.length} outgoing edges from source ${sourceId}`);
```

#### 3. Enhanced Target Node Validation (lines 90-98)

```javascript
const targetNode = nodes.find((node) => node.id === edge.target);

if (!targetNode) {
    console.warn(`[Execution Loop] Target node ${edge.target} not found`);
    return;
}

if (!targetNode.data.wasmHandle) {
    console.warn(`[Execution Loop] Target node ${edge.target} (${targetNode.data.blockType}) has no wasmHandle`);
    return;
}
```

#### 4. Added Success and Type Mismatch Logging (lines 105-113)

```javascript
if (source.type === 'scalar' && targetType === 'ScalarTransformer') {
    setScalarValue(wasmNetwork, handle, value);
    console.log(`[Execution Loop] Set scalar value ${value.toFixed(2)} on ${targetType} (handle: ${handle})`);
} else if (source.type === 'discrete' && targetType === 'DiscreteTransformer') {
    setDiscreteValue(wasmNetwork, handle, value);
    console.log(`[Execution Loop] Set discrete value ${value} on ${targetType} (handle: ${handle})`);
} else {
    console.warn(`[Execution Loop] Type mismatch: ${source.type} source → ${targetType} transformer`);
}
```

### Expected Behavior

Now when the network executes, the browser console will show detailed logging:

```
[Execution Loop] Data sources generated: 2 values
[Execution Loop] Processing source ds-1 (scalar): value = 23.45
[Execution Loop] Found 1 outgoing edges from source ds-1
[Execution Loop] Set scalar value 23.45 on ScalarTransformer (handle: 0)
[Execution Loop] Processing source ds-2 (discrete): value = 4
[Execution Loop] Found 1 outgoing edges from source ds-2
[Execution Loop] Set discrete value 4 on DiscreteTransformer (handle: 1)
```

This makes it easy to diagnose:
- Whether data sources are generating values
- Whether edges are being found
- Whether values are being set on transformers
- Type mismatches between sources and transformers

## Debugging Guide

### How to Verify Issue #1 is Fixed

1. Open the application: http://localhost:5173/
2. Add a data source (Scalar Source or Discrete Source)
3. Add a WASM block (Scalar Transformer, Discrete Transformer, etc.)
4. Initialize and start execution
5. Open the Data Panel (right sidebar)
6. Scroll to "Block States" section
7. **Expected:** Only WASM blocks show bitfield heatmaps
8. **Expected:** Data sources do NOT appear in this section

### How to Verify Issue #2 is Fixed

1. Open the application: http://localhost:5173/
2. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
3. Add a Scalar Source to the canvas
4. Add a Scalar Transformer to the canvas
5. Connect: Scalar Source output → Scalar Transformer input
6. Click "Initialize"
7. Click "Start"
8. **Check Console Output:**
   - You should see: `[Execution Loop] Data sources generated: 1 values`
   - You should see: `[Execution Loop] Processing source ds-X (scalar): value = Y.YY`
   - You should see: `[Execution Loop] Found 1 outgoing edges from source ds-X`
   - You should see: `[Execution Loop] Set scalar value Y.YY on ScalarTransformer (handle: Z)`

### Common Issues and Console Messages

#### Type Mismatch

**Console Output:**
```
[Execution Loop] Type mismatch: scalar source → DiscreteTransformer transformer
```

**Cause:** You connected a Scalar Source to a Discrete Transformer (or vice versa)

**Solution:** Delete the edge and create the correct connection:
- Scalar Source → Scalar Transformer
- Discrete Source → Discrete Transformer

#### No Edges Found

**Console Output:**
```
[Execution Loop] Processing source ds-1 (scalar): value = 23.45
[Execution Loop] Found 0 outgoing edges from source ds-1
```

**Cause:** The data source is not connected to any transformer

**Solution:** Drag from the data source output handle to a transformer input handle

#### Target Node Has No WASM Handle

**Console Output:**
```
[Execution Loop] Target node node-123 (SomeBlock) has no wasmHandle
```

**Cause:** The target node is not a WASM block, or wasn't properly initialized

**Solution:**
- Ensure you connected to a transformer block (not another data source)
- Click "Initialize" to create WASM handles for all blocks

#### Source Not Found

**Console Output:**
```
[Execution Loop] Source ds-123 not found in store
```

**Cause:** The data source was deleted or not properly created

**Solution:** Delete the node and recreate it from the palette

## Performance Impact

### BitField Display Fix

**Before:** O(n) iterations over all nodes, including unnecessary checks for data sources
**After:** O(m) iterations only over WASM blocks where m < n
**Impact:** Slight performance improvement, more significant with many data sources

### Execution Loop Logging

**Before:** Minimal logging, errors swallowed
**After:** Comprehensive logging at each step
**Impact:** Slightly increased console output, but negligible performance impact

**Note:** Logging can be reduced or disabled in production if needed by commenting out or removing console.log statements.
